## Results

Genre-Focused Investments:

Prioritize investment in top-performing genres such as Adventure, Action, Comedy, Drama, Animation, and Sci-Fi, known for strong box office returns. These genres appeal to global audiences, ensuring higher revenue.
Balance with a diversified portfolio, including niche genres like Drama or Independent films, to cater to domestic markets and critical acclaim.
Optimized Release Timing:

Schedule film releases during peak times, notably December, June, May, November, and July, to leverage holiday seasons and summer breaks.
Avoid competing with major releases to maximize audience reach.

Recognize the correlation between higher production budgets and increased profit margins, especially for investments in star power, special effects, and marketing.
Monitor and control production expenses, ensuring they align with the genre's market potential and risk.

## Next Steps
